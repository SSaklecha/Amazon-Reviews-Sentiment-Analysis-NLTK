This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a workflow for performing **Sentiment Analysis** using textual data. The notebook guides users through essential steps, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading**  
  Load and explore datasets to understand the structure and distribution of the text data.

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Includes cleaning and normalizing text by:  
  - Removing special characters and noise.  
  - Tokenizing words and removing stopwords.  
  - Stemming or lemmatizing for standardizing word forms.

- **Feature Extraction**  
  Transform textual data into numerical features using techniques such as vectorization or embeddings.

- **Model Development**  
  Train and evaluate machine learning models to classify sentiment into categories like positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Performance Evaluation**  
  Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.

- **Visualization**  
  Generate visual insights into the dataset, feature distribution, and model results.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**  
  The `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` file is the main notebook implementing all steps of sentiment analysis.  

- **Data Files**  
  Datasets used for training, testing, or validation may be stored in a separate data folder.

- **Outputs**  
  Model performance metrics and visualizations are produced within the notebook.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and follow the step-by-step guide.
2. Replace the dataset or modify preprocessing and model parameters to adapt the notebook for your use case.
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and evaluate results.

## Results and Insights

The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for:  
- Extracting and visualizing insights from text data.  
- Developing and testing machine learning models for sentiment classification.  
- Demonstrating best practices for data preparation and evaluation in text analytics.
